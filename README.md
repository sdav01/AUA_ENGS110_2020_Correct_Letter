Predictive analytics uses historical data to predict future events. Typically, historical data is used to build a mathematical model that captures important trends. That predictive model is then used on current data to predict what will happen next, or to suggest actions to take for optimal outcomes. This tool is going to find in changes different patterns and help people to see whole picture of the situtation. This can be very useful in stock market analysis because it can describe the movement of the price.

This program is going to do calculations depending on the data which user is going to insert and find lots of patterns in that data. So it is going to introduce to user the whole present picture and the picture that is going to be. This can help people to reduce risks when they are deciding what to do and by the same time to find the most efficient way of taking actions.

The problems that this program is going to solve are different. It can be used in stock market analysis and in the analysis of other markets. This tool can be used in different industries and in different ways as it can solve lots of problems like finding the optimal decision in lots of situations.
